## About The Project

This repository contains the source code for a simple weather application that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a user interface and fetch data from the Open Weather API. The application allows the user to enter a city name and get the current weather conditions and temperature for that location. The application also displays an icon that corresponds to the weather description. The code is well-commented and easy to understand.
