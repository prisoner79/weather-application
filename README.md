## About The Project

Welcome to our Weather Application GitHub repository! üå¶Ô∏è‚òÄÔ∏èüåßÔ∏è

Experience the power of real-time weather updates with our dynamic Weather Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project harnesses the OpenWeather API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information right at your fingertips.

With a clean and intuitive user interface crafted using HTML and CSS, navigating through the application is a breeze. Whether you're curious about the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, or a 5-day forecast, our application delivers it all in a visually appealing format.

The magic happens behind the scenes with JavaScript, as it seamlessly interacts with the OpenWeather API to fetch and display weather data for any location you desire. Whether you're planning your day, a trip, or just curious about the weather, our application has you covered.

NOTE :- This repository contains the source code for a simple weather application that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a user interface and fetch data from the Open Weather API. The application allows the user to enter a city name and get the current weather conditions and temperature for that location. The application also displays an icon that corresponds to the weather description. The code is well-commented and easy to understand.
